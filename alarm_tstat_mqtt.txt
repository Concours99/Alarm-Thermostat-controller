- Changed wg_messagesender.py to send to txt.att.net rather than
  mailmymobile.net.  While playing with my home assistant, I found the latter
  didn't work any more.

- Remove all the thermostat controlling code and replace it with mqtt publish
  calls to let the home assistant deal with the thermostat  

Future directions:

- Perhaps make this into a "dumber" solution?
  For example an esp8266 or a modified door/window sensor that home assistant
  already has support for.
